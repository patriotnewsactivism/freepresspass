## Implementation Instructions

### Quick Implementation

For a quick implementation, you can include the `press-pass-improvements.js` file in your HTML:

```html

```

This script will:
1. Override the drawPass function with the improved version
2. Add the "Save to Camera Roll" button
3. Update the existing buttons to track downloads
4. Add the necessary CSS styles

### Complete Implementation

For a more thorough implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Database Schema**
   - Run the SQL migration in `20250924_update_press_passes_table.sql`
   - This adds the `download_type` and `contact_email` fields

2. **Update the API Layer**
   - Replace `api.js` with `modified-api.js`
   - This adds support for tracking different download types

3. **Update the Netlify Function**
   - Replace `netlify/functions/track-pass.js` with `modified-track-pass.js`
   - This handles the new fields and sets the contact email

4. **Update the HTML**
   - Add the new "Save to Camera Roll" button to the actions div
   - Add the event handlers for the new button
   - Update the existing button handlers

5. **Update the CSS**
   - Add the styles from `modified-styles.css` to your existing CSS

6. **Replace the drawPass Function**
   - Replace the existing drawPass function with the one from `modified-drawpass.js`

## Testing

After implementation, test the following:

1. **Organization Name Display**
   - Enter a long organization name (e.g., "We The People News")
   - Verify it displays on a maximum of 2 lines
   - Test with various lengths to ensure proper wrapping

2. **Save to Camera Roll**
   - Test on iOS devices to verify the overlay appears
   - Test on Android devices to verify direct download
   - Test on desktop browsers

3. **Database Tracking**
   - Check the database to verify all download types are tracked
   - Verify the contact email is set correctly
   - Check that user information is saved properly
