# Free Press Pass Generator Fixes

## Issues Identified
- [x] The name is not updating properly on the press pass - it shows "YOUR NAME HERE" by default and only updates after clicking the Generate Press Pass button
- [x] The button text needs to be updated to "Generate FREE Press Pass Now" with "FREE" emphasized
- [x] The second button needs to say "Enhanced/Laminated Version $15" instead of "Get Laminated Pass ($10-15)"
- [x] Need to ensure data is being saved to the database properly

## Solutions

### 1. Fix the Name Update Issue
- [x] Identify the issue in the drawPass function in index.html

### 2. Update Button Text
- [x] Change the first button text to "Generate FREE Press Pass Now" with FREE emphasized
- [x] Change the second button text to "Enhanced/Laminated Version $15"

### 3. Ensure Database Integration

- [x] Ensure the trackPass function is properly sending data to the backend

## Implementation Plan
1. Fix the drawPass function to update the name in real-time
2. Update the button text as requested
3. Test the database integration
4. Deploy the changes
